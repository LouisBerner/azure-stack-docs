# Manage volume encryption with BitLocker on Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 (preview)

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to manage volume encryption and network protection with BitLocker, and how to retrieve recovery keys on your Azure Stack HCI system.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## View settings for volume encryption with BitLocker

### View settings via Azure portal

You can use two kinds of protection, volume encryption and network protection.

- **Volume encryption** - Use volume encryption with BitLocker to encrypt data on your OS volumes and data volumes.
- **Network protection** - Use volume encryption with BitLocker to protect data on the host's network and on VM network connections.

### Manage security settings with PowerShell

## Enable volume encryption

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to save BitLocker keys outside of the system. If the cluster is down and you don't have the key, it could potentially result in data loss.

You can view, enable, and disable volume encryption settings on your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

## PowerShell cmdlet properties

The following cmdlet properties are for volume encryption with BitLocker module: *AzureStackBitLockerAgent*.

- `Get-ASBitLocker` - Scope <Local | PerNode | AllNodes | Cluster>
  - **Local** - Provides BitLocker volume details for the local node. Can be run in a regular remote PowerShell session.
  - **PerNode** - Provides BitLocker volume details per node. Requires CredSSP (when using remote PowerShell) or a remote desktop session (RDP).
- `Enable-ASBitLocker` - Scope <Local | Cluster> -VolumeType <BootVolume | ClusterSharedVolume>
- `Disable-ASBitLocker` - Scope <Local | Cluster> -VolumeType <BootVolume | ClusterSharedVolume>

## View encryption settings for volume encryption with BitLocker

Follow these steps to view encryption settings:

1. Connect to your Azure Stack HCI node.

1. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet using local administrator credentials:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-ASBitLocker
    ```

## Enable, disable volume encryption with BitLocker

Follow these steps to enable volume encryption with BitLocker:

1. Connect to your Azure Stack HCI node.

1. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet using local administrator credentials:

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > - Enabling volume encryption with BitLocker on volume type BootVolume requires TPM 2.0.
   >
   > - While enabling volume encryption with BitLocker on volume type `ClusterSharedVolume` (CSV), the volume will be put in redirected mode and any workload VMs will be paused for a short time. This operation is disruptive; plan accordingly.

    ```PowerShell
    Enable-ASBitLocker
    ```

Follow these steps to disable volume encryption with BitLocker:

1. Connect to your Azure Stack HCI node.

1. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet using local administrator credentials:

    ```PowerShell
    Disable-ASBitLocker
    ```

## Get recovery keys for volume encryption with BitLocker

Follow these steps to get recovery keys for your cluster:

1. Connect to your Azure Stack HCI cluster as local administrator.

1. To get the recovery key information, run the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Get-AsRecoveryKeyInfo | ft ComputerName, PasswordID, RecoveryKey
    ```

   Here is a sample output:

   ```output
    PS C:\Users\ashciuser> Get-AsRecoveryKeyInfo | ft ComputerName, PasswordID, RecoveryKey

    ComputerName    PasswordId    RecoveryKey
    -------         ----------    -----------
    ASB88RR1OU19    {Password1}   Key1
    ASB88RR1OU20    {Password2}   Key2
    ASB88RR1OU21    {Password3}   Key3
    ASB88RR1OU22    {Password4}   Key4
    ```
